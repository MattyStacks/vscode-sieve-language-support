## [1.2.1] - 2025-05-28

### üöÄ Stable Release
- **Promoted to Stable**: All features from 1.2.0 pre-release are now available in the stable channel
- **No Changes**: Identical functionality to 1.2.0 pre-release, just promoted to stable for wider availability

## [1.2.0] - 2025-05-27

### üéâ MAJOR FEATURE: Smart Linting System Added

#### ‚ú® Added
- **üîç Comprehensive Sieve Linting**: Real-time error detection and validation for Sieve scripts
  - **Syntax Validation**: Missing semicolons, malformed statements, empty constructs
  - **Require Statement Validation**: Automatic detection of missing extension requirements
  - **Logic Analysis**: Detection of unreachable code after `keep`, `discard`, `stop`
  - **Best Practice Suggestions**: Recommendations to add `stop` after actions

- **üöÄ ProtonMail-Specific Linting**: Specialized rules for ProtonMail's Sieve implementation
  - **Extension Detection**: Recognition of ProtonMail-specific extensions (`vnd.proton.*`)
  - **Contact List Integration**: Validation for `:addrbook:` and `:incomingdefaults:` usage
  - **Expiration Limits**: Warning when expiration exceeds 730-day maximum
  - **Regex Validation**: Error detection for unsupported regex shorthand (`\b`, `\w`, `\d`)
  - **Folder Path Validation**: Suggestions for proper folder/label escaping
  - **Size Filtering Notes**: Information about encrypted vs. actual size
  - **Vacation Optimization**: Suggestions for `:handle` parameter usage

- **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Linting Settings**: Full user control over linting behavior
  - `sieve.linting.enabled`: Toggle linting on/off
  - `sieve.linting.protonmail`: Enable/disable ProtonMail-specific rules
  - `sieve.linting.bestPractices`: Control best practice suggestions
  - `sieve.linting.severity`: Set minimum severity threshold (error/warning/info)

- **üìù Enhanced Test Files**: Comprehensive linting demonstration
  - `test-protonmail-linter.sieve`: Shows all linting rules in action
  - Examples of both problematic and correct Sieve patterns

#### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Categorized Diagnostics**: Rules organized by type (basic, syntax, best-practice, protonmail)
- **Related Information**: Direct links to ProtonMail documentation for specific rules
- **Configuration Reactivity**: Settings changes apply immediately without restart
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient regex patterns and conditional rule application
- **Smart Expire Validation**: Only warns when expiration exceeds 730 days (not all expire statements)
- **Smart Stop Suggestions**: Context-aware best practice suggestions that recognize when `stop` is already present

### Technical Bug Fixes (Latest Session)
- **Fixed False Warnings**: Removed problematic regex rules that incorrectly flagged all keep/discard/stop statements
- **Enhanced Stop Detection**: Improved algorithm to properly detect stop statements on same line or following lines
- **Terminal Action Validation**: Added smart detection of code after terminal actions on same line
- **Line-by-Line Analysis**: Replaced simple regex matching with intelligent code analysis

#### üìö Linting Rules Include
- **Basic Validation**: Empty require statements, empty string tests, missing semicolons
- **Extension Requirements**: fileinto, vacation, reject, envelope, regex validation
- **ProtonMail Extensions**: expire, extlists, vnd.proton.eval requirements
- **Logic Flow**: Code reachability analysis after terminal actions
- **Best Practices**: stop statement suggestions, vacation handle recommendations
- **ProtonMail Limits**: Expiration time validation, regex shorthand warnings

### üéØ Use Cases
- **Email Filter Development**: Write Sieve scripts with confidence
- **ProtonMail Users**: Specialized support for ProtonMail's implementation
- **Learning Sieve**: Educational feedback for Sieve language learners
- **Script Maintenance**: Easy identification of issues in existing scripts
